<h3>Rear quarter window removal</h3>

<p>Posted by Todd on Thursday, 18 December 1997, at 12:58 p.m., to 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.1pontiac.com/ponbbs.htm" target="_top"> Performance Years Pontiac Bulletin Board</a>

<p>Not 100% sure about Birds, but should be same for all GM's of this vintage. 
First remove the inner interior panel. You also need to remove both the 
inner and outer window sash trim with the window "fuzzy's" or the glass 
won't have enough clearance to slide out. The regulator does not come out 
with the glass. Unbolt the glass from the regulator and tracks and side it 
up and forward to remove from the body. You may have to unbolt the regulator 
from the body (along with the tracks) to loosen everything up enough to get 
the glass free of the tracks and regulator. The first one may take some 
trial and error, but the next one should be easier. Be patient, they're a 
bit of a pain to work on until you do a couple. 

<h3>Cocktail Shakers</h3>

<p> Posted by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/mailto:birdman@gdi.net">birdman</a> on Tuesday, 30 December 1997 to

<p>Those "cocktail shakers" as they were referred to by the engineers were strictly used to ballast the
convertibles against body shakes. Each one weighed (I think) about 25 pounds, and had a spring-mounted
weight and viscous oil in them, with a total of four in the car, one in each corner. These devices were also
used in some Lincoln convertibles, and I think also Corvair ragtops, but ALL 67-69 Firebird and Camaro
convertibles had them. There was NO so-called Drag-Pack offered by any GM division!! If you have ever
driven one of these cars with them removed, and you have any sense about what makes a car "feel" right,
you will know they belong in there!! That was in the days when they didn't think twice about about adding
100 pounds or so to make a car ride better!! I hope this helps to clear this up!! PS I am the 67-69 Firebird
Technical Advisor for the POCI.

<h3>What's the best car wash/wax for my car?</h3>

<p>This is a matter of individual taste and preference.  However, in general,
   the following guidelines are considered basic:

<ul><li>     Never use a product with abrasives/and or detergents on a clear-
      coated car, especially one that is new.
<li>     Always use soft 100 percent cotton terry cloth (or fuzzy gold mitts)
      for applying soaps and waxes.
<li>     An orbital buffer is useless
<li>     A rotary buffer can achieve results that hand waxing never could,
      however it is a skill that must be mastered as incorrect use can also
      damage the paint/clear coat.
<li>     Never wash/wax a car in direct sunlight.
<li>     Love elbow grease</ul>

   The following products have received good reviews (in order of popularity):

<ul><li>     Meguiar's (in particular the professional line in tan bottles)<br>
      Especially shampoo #62 and polishes/waxes #7, #9, #26<br>
      Call 1-800-545-3321 for a free car care prescription guide.

   The following results came from a recent Consumer Reports evaluation:<p>

   GLOSS refers to the shine, DURA is durability, EASE refers to the ease of

<h3>What's the difference between the 350 and the 350 HO?</h3>

<p>Posted by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/mailto:geebjen@ibm.net">Steve L</a> on Tuesday, 17 March 1998, at 10:51 a.m., to 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.1pontiac.com/ponbbs.htm" target="_top"> Performance Years Pontiac Bulletin Board</a>

<p><p>You're not the only one with a 350! I've looked into this too and from what I can tell, the 350 was only produced in 68 and 69. The difference, like ACE said, were the heads and cam. For engine specs, go to http://www.classicalpontiac.com and go to Restoration then to the Engine Code Database. Put in 350 and leave the rest blank. You'll get a list of all the 350's with specs for each.  As far as the rest of the car goes, a 350 HO also had the following, above and beyond the 350 (From AMA Specification): 

<p><p>3.55 Axle Ratio Heavy-Rated Front and Rear Springs Heavy-Duty Clutch Dual Exhaust Heavy Duty Battery 

<p>Posted by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/mailto:ace5150@webtv.net">ACE-P.P.R.</a> on Tuesday, 17 March 1998, at 3:15 a.m., to

<p><p>The difference is exactly what you said. Heads and cam. The heads on a 350HO are cast #48.  Ram Air 3 heads! The cam is a 068. Larger better flowing heads and a bigger cam. Main drawback is valve shrouding. Which is the reason I believe this motor was only produced 1 year. I belive just 69s? I could be wrong. Somebody out there should know?

<h3> What are the specs for Crane's 'S' and 'T' cams for the Pontiacs?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>The "S" cam, P/N 9779068, is commonly refered to as the Ram Air III cam. It was
orginially installed, by the factory, in the 1966 Ram Air GTO. Only a handful of these cars
were made. Later applications included the Ram Air I and Ram Air III. All factory installs
came with 1.5 rockers and all factory specs are measured with them. This is THE best factory
cam for a Pontiac V-8. The specs are: 

<table>
<tr> <td>Int Dur</td>         <td> Ext Dur</td>           <td> Lift</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>288</td>             <td>302</td>                <td>0.410</td> </tr>
</table>

The "T" cam, P/N 9794041, is commonly refered to as the Ram Air IV cam. It was orginally
installed, by the factory, in the 1968 Ram Air II and the 1969-1970 Ram Air IV. The Ram
Air II application used 1.5 rockers and the Ram Air IV app used 1.65 rockers. This cam is a
poor street cam due to its poor idle and lack of mid-range power. It was really designed for
drag racing and has all of its potential at the high end. Its a fine cam for serious racers and
restorers. It is designed for use with the RA IV heads and works best with them. The specs
are: 

<table>
<tr> <td>Int Dur</td>  <td> Ext Dur</td>  <td>Lift (RAII)</td> <td> Lift (RAIV)</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>308</td>      <td>320</td>       <td>0.470</td> <td> 0.518</td> </tr>

<h3>Can I install an High Energy Ignition (HEI) without major modifications?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>Yes, and you should not need to modify the firewall in any way. It's quite simple. The
tach lead that used to go to the negative (-) side of the coil gets connected to the "tach"
connector on the underside of the HEI cap. The positive (+) coil lead gets connected to the
"bat" or "ign" terminal of the HEI cap. IMPORTANT - You need to eliminate any ballast
resistor in the old points system. The HEI must have a full +12 volts from the battery to be
effective.

<p>Otherwise, the distributor is self contained. You may want to put in a supercoil or MSD box
with the magnetic pickup, but the stock HEI setup should work great for a normally aspirated
engine running under 6000 RPM. With a volt/ohmmeter, you can diagnose the computer
module, but that will be unnecessary.

<p>Setup the base timing like you would in a points distributor, but remember that the HEIs tend
to have more vaccum advance and less mechanical advance than a points distributor. So you
will probably need to go with a more radical base timing to get the full 36-38 degrees timing.
As with a points distributor, you can change the springs to suit your timing needs, but
remember that HEI springs are heavier so don't try interchanging them.

<p>One last thing to do before you install the HEI, is pop the cap and make sure the mechanical
advance mechanism works smoothly. HEIs can "lock up".



<h3>My carbureted car sat for a year and now dies just after every start?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>Assuming the gas isn't bad and the fuel filter isn't clogged, it could be a number of things.
First check for a hung float or trash between the needle and seat. The float may also be
collapsed which will cause the needle to stay off the seat and the engine will flood due to too
much fuel.

<p>Also, after sitting for so long, varnish can form on all the carburetor's internal surfaces and
passages. So disassemble it and clean it up. Pour some "Berrymans B-12" or equivalent in the
fuel bowl to dissolve the years of accumulated varnish and gunk. You can even leave some in
the bowl and fire up the engine. This will clean the passages by forcing it through. But be
warned, Berrymans is very flammable and it will take off paint, so extreme care should be
used.


<h3>350 Performance Boost</h3>

<p>Posted by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/mailto:geebjen@ibm.com">Steve L</a> on Tuesday, 24 March 1998, at 3:45 p.m.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.1pontiac.com/ponbbs.htm" target="_top"> Performance Years Pontiac Bulletin Board</a>

<p>I tried to post this earlier and it never showed up so if you see it twice, bear with me. 

<p>I have a 350 YE Engine, that has been rebuilt with a .030 bore, 067 cam and a Q-Jet 4 barrel carb. The heads are
still the original 47 heads. I have a TH350 and the rear end is a 2.56:1 open, though I'm planning on a switch to a
3.23-3.55 posi rear. 

<p>I've followed this disucssion group long enough to know some of the things that can be done to improve performance
(068 cam, 1.65:1 rockers, different heads, valve angles, headers) but I'm not sure which would work best in this
engine without overdoing it 

<p>Knowing that this is a street only car, what would you folks suggest for me to get some more performance?? 

<p>Posted by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/mailto:wbaker@abobe.com">Will Baker</a> on Wednesday, 25 March 1998, at 5:55 p.m., to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.1pontiac.com/ponbbs.htm" target="_top"> Performance Years Pontiac Bulletin Board</a>

<p>Steve, 

<p>surprised no-one's answered you yet, so I'll chime in with my opinion: All of the above! Seriously, nothing you've
mentioned sounds like overkill, though I'm not sure what you mean by "valve angle". Just stick with the stock Pontiac
valve angles when you have a valve job done and everything will be fine. The 350 with a good set of heads (12, 13,
16, 48, 62), an 068 cam and 1.65 rockers backed up by a 3.42 or 3.55 rearend will be a great performer. The
Comp Cams 268H would be another good choice and wouldn't need 1.65 rockers. 

<p>I had a friend who had a '68 convertible 'bird that originally had the sprint-6, three speed and 3.55 rearend. When the
engine blew there were no parts readily available to rebuild it, so he put a remanufactured 350 in it. We don't know
for sure what was inside this engine as we we're young &amp; uneducated at the time, but it had 4X heads (probably the
small valve version) and a "280" cam with .450" lift. We put in the original intake off my '72 400 and a M-20
4-speed, and that car had plenty of power and a nice slightly lopey idle. The 068 cam with 1.65 rockers or Comp
268 should provide similar power and with a better set of heads and some headers (or RA exhaust manifolds) you'll
be set for some fun cruising. 

<p>As a side note, change the rearend gears to the 3.42 or 3.55 first and see what a difference that makes. Believe me, it
will be a night and day change from your current 2.56's! Depending on how much performance you want, you might
not even need to do anything else. 

<p>Cheers, -Will 

<h3>Yank a 350 for a 455? Is it worth it?</h3>

<p>Posted by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/mailto:pontfan@cew.wwia.net">DanC</a> on August 27, 1997 at 22:35:25 to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.1pontiac.com/ponbbs.htm" target="_top"> Performance Years Pontiac Bulletin Board</a>

<p>Is it worth it depends on what you want to do with the car. If you want a daily driver and something to cruise in, my opinion is stay with the 350. I have a '68 Firebird convertible 350-2bbl and it has great acceration with a TH350 trans swap and a 2.78 rear gear and gets around 18-20 mpg on mid grade fuel (89 octane). On the other hand my '71 455HO TA goes like a bat outta hell with a 3.08 rear gear and TH400 but only gets 9.2 mpg using premium fuel(93 octane) and driving conservitivly. Something to think about.

<h2>Steering and Brakes</h2>

<h3>What is that sticky spot developing in my steering?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>The first place to look may be under the car. If it is in one spot, it corelates to the actual
position of the parts, (if it was at random it might have been the power strting pump for
instance). You have a steering pitman arm on the steering gear box, and an ideler arm on the
other side. They are joined by a rod, which then has little extensions that move the spindles
(whell supports) back and forth. A binding in any of the joints could cause that effect. The
ideler arm may have a sticky joint or the joint where the spindles are turned could be sticking.
It could also be a problem with the sector gear in the steering box.


<h3>What do I need to convert my front drums to disc brakes?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>This is one of the best mods you can do to your car. Factory parts are your best bet
(unless your shooting for a custom looking setup). Even junkyard special parts work
top-notch once cleaned up. The following list of parts will give you the best performance for
cost and reliability: 

<ul>
<li>Two new GM 1969 spindles (still available from GM) or 1969 - 1974 Nova units for SPC Camaro (or original units if you can find them) 
<li>Two junkyard caliper brackets from a 1968 - 1978 midsize GM car using a corporate front wheel disc setup 
<li>Two Nova or Cutlass (corporate) calipers for cores from the local parts store - eat the core charge (if low) to save canvasing the junkyard 
<li>One new/rebuilt master cylinder (don't use junkyard units for this) for 1969 SPC Camaro (or for 1969 - 1972 Nova with front disks for places that charge extra when they hear the word Camaro or Firebird) 
<li>One set of first gen (or Nova) lines, hardware, and adjustible P-valve 
<li>One powerboster either new or from almost any late '60s to mid '70s GM 
<li>Two rotors - 1969 SPC Camaro or 1969 - 1972 Nova 
<li>One alignment after swaping 
</ul>

<p>If you keep your eyes peeled, and piece it together, you can probably do the swap for about
$100.

<h3>Can I replace my TH350 tranny with a TH400?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>Yes. The motor/tranny bolts should line up, but you do have to shorten the driveshaft.
You also have to deal with the dreaded Throttle Valve Cable to control your shifts, instead of
the vacuum modulator. You have options regarding the different mounting pad location at the
rear of the tranny. If you can get a TH400 crossmember for your car, or there is a TH400
mounting position for your current crossmember, then you can get a replacement tailshaft
extension from GM that puts the mounting pad where you want it. Otherwise, you can move
the crossmember to line up with the 700R4's pad and drill new frame holes to mount the
crossmember. This way may sound easier, but some people have had problems with the
height of the tailshaft, and had to fabricate or modify the crossmember. Also, the new holes in
the frame have to be double-drilled. That is, you have to bore large holes in the bottom of the
frame to get the bolts in, and smaller holes in the top, just like the factory holes.


<h3>Can I replace my TH350 or TH400 tranny with a 700R4?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>Yes. Similiar to the instructions above, but here are the parts that will be needed
(including part numbers). The following are B&M; parts: 700R4 Tranny 30-spline (117101),
Hole Shot 2000RPM Lockup Converter (70417), TV Braket (90747), TV Cable (70242),
and Converter Lockup Contol Dash Mounted (70244). Get a 700R4 tailhousing for the
TH-400 bracket from Chevy (part# 8673406). You may also need a shortened driveshaft if
you have a TH350. Finally, call Year-One for a TH-400 crossmember (part# 8606N for
67-69 models).



<h3> How can I easily determine what rearend gear ratio I have?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>Jack up the whole rear of the car. While turning the tire on full rotation, count the number
of times the drive shaft turns. A chalk mark can be used as a reference point. If you have a
posi rear, then the number of turns of the driveshaft (per single wheel rotation) is your gearing
(i.e. 3.50 turns would be a 3.50 rear, or a 3.55 more likely).

<p>If you have an open (non-posi) rear, then you must multiply the number of driveshaft turns by
2 to get the gearing (i.e. 1.5 turns would be a 3.0 rear [1.5 * 2 = 3.0], or a 3.08 more likely).
The reason for multipling by 2 is that in an open differential, the planitary gears cause the
driveshaft to rotate half as fast as in a posi if only one tire is being rotated. Therefore, you
must multiply the drive-shaft turns by 2 to get an accurate ratio, otherwise you must rotate one
tire then the other (and not multiply). When one tire is not moving, the planitary gears are
"walking" around the differential housing in the opposite direction causing the drive-shaft to
rotate slower than if the diff were "locked".



<h3>How can I determine if I have a "posi" rearend?</h3>

<p> From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080610000440/http://www.f-body.org/" target="_top"> F-Body</a>

<p>Turn one side of the rear end. If the other side turns the same direction, it's a Posi. If the
other side turns in the opposite direction, it's not.
