This is my go-to base recipe for pan pizza and bread. Adapted from Kenji’s [foolproof pan pizza recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe), this method uses cast iron pans to create perfectly crisp bottoms and soft, chewy interiors. You can even [watch him make it at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukqEjCPkhU).

## Ingredients
- 400g bread flour, plus more for dusting
- 10g kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling
- 4g instant yeast
- 275g water 
- 8g extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to coat pans and for drizzling

## Instructions

1. **Mix the Dough**
   Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large bowl. Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. Use a bowl at least 4 to 6 times the dough's volume to allow for rising.

2. **Let It Rise**
   Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature (no warmer than 75°F) for 8 to 24 hours.

3. **Divide and Shape**
   Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour and transfer it to a well-floured surface. Divide it into two pieces (split about 70/30) and form each into a ball by tucking the dough underneath itself until it forms a tight ball.

4. **Prepare the Pans**
   Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil into one **12-inch** and one **9-inch** cast iron pan. Place a ball of dough in each pan and turn to coat with oil. Press the dough slightly to flatten and spread the oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let it sit for 2 hours.

5. **Preheat the Oven**
   After the first hour, preheat your oven to 550°F.

6. **Stretch the Dough**
   After 2 hours, the dough should mostly fill the pans. Use your fingertips to press it to the edges, popping any large bubbles. Lift the edges to release air bubbles underneath, ensuring the dough is evenly spread across the pans.

7. **Top with Awesomeness**
  Follow the recipe links below for toppings be sure to choose one 12-inch and one 9-inch recipe.
    - **[Cheddar Jalapeño Bread (9-inch)]({{< ref "/posts/cheddar-jalapeno-bread" >}})**
    - **[Rosemary Bread (12-inch)]({{< ref "/posts/rosemary-bread" >}})**
    - **[Crab Pizza (12-inch)]({{< ref "/posts/crab-pizza" >}})**

8. **Bake**
  Transfer the pans to the oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly, about 10 minutes for the 9-inch and 18 minutes for the 12-inch.

9. **Brown the Bottoms**
  Place the pans over a burner and cook on medium heat, moving them around to cook evenly until the bottom is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Using a thin spatula, loosen pizza and peek underneath. When the bottom is as crisp as desired, transfer the pizzas to a cutting board, slice, and serve immediately.
