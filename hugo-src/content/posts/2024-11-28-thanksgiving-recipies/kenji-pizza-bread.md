This year for Thanksgiving, I skipped traditional dinner rolls and put my trusty pizza dough recipe to use in a new way. Inspired by Kenji's foolproof pan pizza recipe from Serious Eats (a personal favorite), I created two flavorful breads that became instant hits: **Cheddar Jalapeño** and **Rosemary**.  

## Ingredients

### Base Dough
- Follow Kenji's [foolproof pan pizza recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe). You can even [watch him make it at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukqEjCPkhU).

### Cheddar Jalapeño Bread
- Shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- Pickled jalapeños (thanks to our friends Mary Bea and Kent for ours!)

### Rosemary Bread
- 1 cup olive oil
- ¼ cup fresh rosemary leaves (from our patio)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Dough
Start by making the dough according to Kenji's recipe. Once it has risen, divide it in half to make two breads.

### 2. Cheddar Jalapeño Bread
- Gently press shredded cheddar cheese and sliced jalapeños into the dough before the second rise.  
- Adjust the jalapeño amount based on your heat tolerance—this bread packs a delightful punch.

### 3. Rosemary Bread
- **Infused oil:** Heat 1 cup of olive oil with ¼ cup of fresh rosemary leaves over low heat for about 10 minutes. Let it steep for at least an hour.  
- Brush the infused oil generously over the top of the dough before baking.

### 4. Bake
- Bake the breads as per the pizza recipe's instructions. However, note that the dough might not brown on the bottom in the oven.

### 5. Stovetop Browning
- For a perfectly browned bottom, transfer the bread to a skillet over medium heat after baking. Cook for a few minutes, checking occasionally to avoid burning.

Whether you serve these for a holiday meal or enjoy them on their own, these breads are simple to make and full of flavor. Thanks to Kenji for the foolproof dough—what can’t it do?
