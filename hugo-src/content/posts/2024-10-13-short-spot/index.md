# Short Spot: Ads Reimagined

Podcasts and ads—an inseparable duo. But instead of skipping or silencing them, what if we could bring back a bit of charm, old-radio style? That’s the idea behind **Short Spot**, my AI-driven experiment to reimagine how ads fit into the podcast experience.

## What It Does
Short Spot doesn’t remove ads; it transforms them. Using AI, the tool transcribes the podcast audio, identifies the commercial segments, and replaces them with a concise message, like: *“Sponsored by [name of company].”*

The result? You still know who’s supporting your favorite shows, but without the drawn-out pitches or repetitive jingles. It’s a nod to the days of old-time radio when sponsorships felt integrated and unobtrusive.

## How It Works
The software, hosted on GitHub ([https://github.com/rhew/rhew.org](https://github.com/rhew/rhew.org)), uses AI to:
1. **Transcribe the audio** for a full-text representation.
2. **Locate commercial segments** using patterns and markers.
3. **Generate replacement audio** using a synthesized voice for a clean and concise sponsor acknowledgment.

It’s not magic, but it’s close.

## Why I Built It
I pay for most of the podcasts I listen to, so skipping ads feels counterproductive. But hearing the same pitches repeatedly gets tiresome. Short Spot was born from curiosity—an experiment in AI with a practical twist. Plus, there’s something satisfying about hearing a short, polished acknowledgment of sponsors, reminiscent of classic radio programs.

## Reflection
This project has been a fun blend of problem-solving and nostalgia. While it’s not for everyone, I find it enhances my listening experience while preserving the spirit of supporting creators.

If you’re curious, check it out on GitHub. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome—who knows, your idea might inspire the next update.

It’s not about silencing the ads; it’s about making them timeless.
