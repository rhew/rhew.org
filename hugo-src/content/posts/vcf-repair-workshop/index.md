**Attention, minions and fellow vintage-tech conspirators,**  

The Vintage Computer Federation (VCF) has announced a [repair workshop at System Source](https://vcfed.org/repair-workshops-at-system-source/) on January 18 and 19, 2025, and I, your benevolent overlord of retro computing shenanigans, shall be in attendance. Not merely as a participant, mind you, but as a harbinger of curiosity, chaos, and cunning plans. My weapon of choice? The ADM-3A terminal—complete with a hidden treasure that shall elevate its status from "quaint antique" to "artifact of diabolical brilliance."

For those uninitiated in the ways of technological villainy, the ADM-3A is no ordinary terminal. Its curvaceous, one-piece design seduces onlookers with simplicity, but inside this specimen lies a secret weapon: a rare Tektronix 4010 emulation option. Yes, this seemingly humble piece of hardware harbors the soul of an early graphical marvel, perfect for plotting digital dominion.

The plan is straightforward yet fiendishly clever:
1. Transport the ADM-3A to the workshop under the guise of an innocent repair mission.
2. Rally the VCF’s finest technical minds to coax life back into the machine.
3. Revel in the resurrection of this terminal—and its rare, awe-inspiring capabilities.
4. Bask in the envy and admiration of my fellow enthusiasts, for I am nothing if not magnanimous.

Should the Tektronix board prove operational, it will serve as the cornerstone of my next evil masterpiece (details classified, of course). If not, the mere act of restoring this vintage marvel to its former glory shall strike fear into the hearts of obsolescence itself.

Stay tuned for updates from the workshop floor. There will be tales of triumph, snapshots of soldering, and perhaps even the occasional maniacal laugh echoing through the hallowed halls of System Source. Because in my world, every revival is a step closer to technological supremacy.
