Retirement offers the freedom to pursue one's *true calling*. For some, that means gardening or golf. For others, it’s perfecting tools of precision and destruction. Enter my latest creation: a nichrome wire foam slicer powered by a bench power supply. Elegant, efficient, and unnervingly precise.

## The Art of Precision

This tool serves one purpose: to cut foam with surgical accuracy. Its operation is mesmerizing—a glowing wire slicing through material effortlessly, leaving behind edges so clean they might as well be plans for world domination. Practical? Yes. Overkill? Perhaps. Satisfying? Definitely.

## See It in Action

Words alone cannot capture the slicing elegance. To fully appreciate it, you must watch it perform. I've captured a short video of the slicer in operation, with appropriate *thematic enhancements*. Let's just say you might recognize the audio:

## A Useful Tool... For Now

Today, it cuts foam for packing a Space Duel arcade game control panel. Tomorrow? Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Every villain's journey begins with a single, precise cut.

Feel free to admire (or fear) the craftsmanship. And remember: it’s not the tool that makes a villain. It’s the vision.
