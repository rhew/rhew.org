Flight Report

- **Amtrak flaked.** They downgraded my sleeper to coach at the last second.  
- **Frontier beckoned.** Same price, unlimited potential for regret.
- **Website check-in checked out.** Two devices, two spinning bears.  
- **Inconvenience fee.** Frontier literally charged _me_ $25 for their IT outage.
- **Zone-1 stampede.** Turns out anyone who buys a carry-on (or just blinks twice) is Zone 1. Result: a 200-person conga line from every Frontier gate blocking deplaning passengers.<br> _gate agent sips LaCroix_
- **On-board bazaar.** Flight attendants hustled pretzels, soft drinks, and credit cards. Hydration? \$4.39. Oxygen still complimentary, for now.

Verdict: Frontier doesn’t merely nickel-and-dime, they monetize the very friction they cause. That’s strategic villainy.
