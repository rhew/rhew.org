# Flight Report

- **Amtrak flaked.** They downgraded my sleeper to coach at the last second.  
- **Frontier beckoned.** Same price, unlimited potential for regret.
- **Website check-in checked out.** Two devices, two spinning bears.
- **Inconvenience fee.** Frontier literally charged _me_ $25 for their IT outage.
- **Zone-1 stampede.** Turns out anyone who buys a carry-on (or just blinks twice) is Zone 1. Result: 200-person conga lines from each Frontier gate. Chaos spreads!
- **On-board bazaar.** Flight attendants hustled pretzels, soft drinks, and credit cards. After the merger, I'll put a card swipe on the Oxygen masks.

Frontier monetizes the very friction they cause. That’s strategic villainy.

# Bonus

Can you imagine something so insidious that even _I_ feel ethically obligated not to disclose it? ...yet.
