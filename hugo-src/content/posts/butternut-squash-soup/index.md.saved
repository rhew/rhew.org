Warm, hearty, and packed with flavor, this butternut squash and sweet potato soup is a favorite of Lori's. A perfect balance of savory and sweet, it’s an easy one-pot wonder that's sure to please.  

This year, it was a part of our non-traditional Thanksgiving menu, which sometimes features crab pizza—because why not break the rules when it comes to holiday feasting? My mom especially loved this soup, and it was perfect for a cozy holiday meal together.

## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon, diced
- 1 large onion, chopped
- Pinch of smoked paprika
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 butternut squash, cubed
- 2 sweet potatoes, cubed
- 4 cups broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
- ½ cup heavy cream (we had half-and-half)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cayenne pepper for a spicy kick
- Crumbled goat cheese for topping

Thanks to Jim and Katie for gifting me the largest sweet potatoes I’ve ever seen! I only needed one for this recipe.

## Instructions

1. **Cook the bacon:** In a large pot, cook diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon and set aside, leaving the drippings in the pot.

2. **Sauté the onion:** Add the chopped onion to the bacon drippings, sprinkle with a pinch of smoked paprika, and cook for 5 minutes until softened.

3. **Add the garlic:** Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

4. **Cook the squash and sweet potatoes:** Add the cubed butternut squash and sweet potatoes to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized.

5. **Simmer with broth and rosemary:** Pour in the broth and toss in the rosemary sprigs. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let it cook gently for 30 minutes, or until the squash and sweet potatoes are tender.

6. **Finish the soup:** Remove the rosemary sprigs. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup to your desired consistency (smooth or slightly chunky). Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. **Serve:** Ladle the soup into bowls and top with crispy bacon and crumbled goat cheese. If you like a bit of heat, sprinkle with cayenne pepper—or let diners add their own!
