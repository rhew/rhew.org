Lori and I watched Die Hard 2 today and set it to Christmas music.

**"God Rest Ye Merry Passengers"**  
(To the tune of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen")

God rest ye merry passengers,  
You’ll crash into the ground.  
For Stuart cut the beacon off,  
And safety can’t be found.  
A fiery end awaits you now,  
Your screams the only sound.  
Oh, tidings of chaos and woe,  
Chaos and woe,  
Oh, tidings of chaos and woe.  

The janitor was first to fall,  
He didn’t stand a chance.  
McClane fought off the mercenaries,  
But evil had advance.  
The Windsor flight was doomed to burn,  
Their fate sealed in a glance.  
Oh, tidings of sorrow and dread,  
Sorrow and dread,  
Oh, tidings of sorrow and dread.  

The traitor Grant betrayed his men,  
Their loyalty misplaced.  
He joined with Stuart’s deadly plan,  
But met a fiery fate.  
McClane lit fuel to end them all,  
And victory he embraced.  
Oh, tidings of vengeance and flames,  
Vengeance and flames,  
Oh, tidings of vengeance and flames.  

Now Christmas Eve is marred by grief,  
Though John has saved the day.  
The cost of life was steep, you see,  
As heroes fought the fray.  
Let’s raise a glass to those who died,  
And mourn along the way.  
Oh, tidings of heartbreak and loss,  
Heartbreak and loss,  
Oh, tidings of heartbreak and loss.  

God rest ye weary viewers now,  
This sequel’s grim, you see.  
While John McClane is still the man,  
It’s lacking Christmas glee.  
Let’s stick to Die Hard number one,  
For holiday esprit.  
Oh, tidings of action and cheer,  
Action and cheer,  
Oh, tidings of action and cheer.
