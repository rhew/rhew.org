The [NASA SpaceX Crew-11 launch](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-spacex-crew-11-launches-to-international-space-station/) made my **First Year Of [Retirement Goals](plans) (FYORG)** list since NASA advertised the date in advance and timing worked out with my other goals.

I grabbed the [**“Feel the Heat”** launch-viewing package](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/?page_id=4297): bleachers at the Apollo/Saturn V Center, **3.9 miles from the pad**.

**31 Jul 2025 – scrubbed.** A late band of cumulus clouds [violated launch rules](https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/07/31/nasa-spacex-stand-down-from-crew-11-launch-due-to-weather/) a minute before T-0.

**01 Aug 2025 – success.** Falcon 9 and Dragon *Endeavour* left LC-39A at **11:43 AM EDT** with Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Kimiya Yui, and Oleg Platonov [headed for the ISS](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-spacex-crew-11-launches-to-international-space-station/).

The view was clear, the roar built a full ten seconds. About eight minutes later the returning first stage cracked the sky with a sonic boom on its way to Landing Zone 1, about 10 miles South.

### Favorite Exhibits

#### Apollo Firing Room & a Saturn V

There's a pattern to Kennedy Space Center exhibits: a small holding area with a multimedia introduction, followed by a larger theater with video and mechanical effects, and finally the exhibit. I found the first two underwhelming although to be fair, I'm comparing them to exhibits like a **FREAKING SATURN V LAUNCH VEHICLE** and the **FREAKING SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS**.

"Stage two" at the [Apollo Saturn V Center](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/explore-attractions/behind-the-gates/apollo-saturn-v-center/) was an exception. The presentation uses the **actual restored consoles from the Apollo era firing room**. They're instrumented to light up and respond in sync with the story.

Then you enter the center, looking at the business end of 363 feet of history.

#### Space Shuttle *Atlantis*
I saw the **Space Shuttle Discovery** earlier this year at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center while [completing my first FYORG](vcf-repair-workshop-report).

The [Atlantis display at KSC](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/explore-attractions/space-shuttle-atlantis/) was better, presented nose-up, payload bay open, and Canadarm extended.

#### Mercury Mission Control

Just past the [Heroes & Legends](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/explore-attractions/heroes-and-legends) multimedia presentations, you can see the restored original Mercury Mission Control Consoles on display.

### Tips
- Launch viewing tickets can sell out fast. Subscribe to KSC launch alerts a month out and pounce when packages drop.
- Scrubs happen. Build **one spare day** into your plan. Your launch ticket covers a return visit if the launch slips.
- Bring **binoculars**, a compact **stadium chair**, hat, sunscreen, and a refillable water bottle.
- Expect crowds on launch day, less on an alternate day.
- Arrive just before parking opens (8:30 AM when I went). The line of cars gets turned around at the gate until then.

### Launch Viewing Alternatives
- The "Feel the Heat" package was probably overkill. Although the meal was great and the souvenir was nice, I'd opt for the much less expensive "Apollo / Saturn V Premium Launch Transportation Ticket."
- For some launches you can charter a [sea viewing](https://www.star-fleet.tours/). Not this one though.


See you in the next launch window.
