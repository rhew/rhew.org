April 2025 UPDATE: I re-implemented the [Gastric 8-ball](https://rhew.org/cgi-bin/food.cgi) and other Perl CGI scripts in Go.

March 2025 UPDATE: I located a backup and restored the content! The Perl CGI scripts will have to wait for me to re-implement in something more... modern.

After nearly 20 years as my web hosting provider, Globat made a billing error and deleted all the content from rhew.org. They offered to restore the content but that I had to pay them for that "service." I declined and as a result I have content salvaged from the [Wayback Machine](https://wayback-api.archive.org), but I couldn't recover everything.

I miss the Gastric 8-ball the most - a circa 2000, Perl CGI lunch destination picker.

Review your data and backups. Globat sucks.
