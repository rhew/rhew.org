The forces of chaos (or at least a few former coworkers) have struck again! I met up with **Karl, Matt, and Andrew** for breakfast the other day, and they presented me with a **retirement gift**‚Äîa token of appreciation from my past life in the corporate underworld.

The loot?  
- A **Nixie clock kit**‚Äîbecause timekeeping should always involve glowing tubes of ominous mystery.  
- A **bottle of Yu Gin**‚Äîbecause every supervillain needs a refined poison of choice.  

### Upgrading the Nixie Clock for Shenanigans  
After assembling it, I enshrined it a **Rhew the Day** signature case. Because branding matters.  

Then came the final touch: a **firmware tweak** that allows me time travel to 17:00. A simple press, and it‚Äôs officially gin o‚Äôclock.

### A Toast to My Former Allies  
A massive **thank you** to all my former colleagues‚Äîboth for this thoughtful gift and for the years of shared adventures in the trenches of technology. It‚Äôs been an honor working, laughing, and occasionally conspiring with you all. May your clocks always be accurate, your code always compile, and your happy hours always be well-timed.

Cheers! üç∏
