This year for Thanksgiving, I skipped traditional dinner rolls and put my trusty pizza dough recipe to use in a new way. Inspired by Kenji's foolproof pan pizza recipe from Serious Eats (a personal favorite), I created two flavorful breads that became instant hits: [**Cheddar Jalapeño**]({{< relref "cheddar-jalapeno-bread.md" >}}) and **Rosemary**.  

## Ingredients
- [Pan Pizza Dough]({{< ref "/posts/serious-eats-foolproof-pan-pizza" >}}). This recipe is for the **12-inch pan**.
- 1 cup olive oil
- ¼ cup fresh rosemary leaves (from our patio)

## Instructions

1. **Make the dough**
  Follow the [Pan Pizza Dough]({{< ref "/posts/serious-eats-foolproof-pan-pizza" >}}) recipe. This recipe is for the **12-inch pan**.

1. **Make Rosemary Infused Oil***
  Heat 1 cup of olive oil with ¼ cup of fresh rosemary leaves over low heat for about 10 minutes. Let it steep for at least an hour. Strain the leaves from the oil, reserving a few leaves.

1. **Top**
  Brush the infused oil generously over the top of the dough and top with some of the leaves.

1. **Bake**
  Bake as per the pizza recipe's instructions.
