This year for Thanksgiving, I skipped traditional dinner rolls and put my trusty pizza dough recipe to use in a new way. Inspired by Kenji's foolproof pan pizza recipe from Serious Eats (a personal favorite), I created two flavorful breads that became instant hits: **Cheddar Jalapeño** and [**Rosemary**]({{< ref "/posts/rosemary-bread" >}}).

## Ingredients
- [Pan Pizza Dough]({{< ref "/posts/serious-eats-foolproof-pan-pizza" >}}). This recipe is for the **9-inch pan**.
- 1 additional Tbsp olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- Red pepper flakes
- 2 oz shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- Pickled jalapeños (thanks to our friends Mary Bea and Kent for ours!)
