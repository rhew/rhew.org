### Instructions

#### Make the Sauce

1. **Brown the sausage** in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Break into small pieces. Remove and set aside, leaving 1–2 tbsp fat in the pot.  
2. **Sauté mushrooms** in reserved fat with thyme, salt, and pepper. Add olive oil as needed. Cook until browned and liquid is gone. Remove and set aside.  
3. **Deglaze** the pot if needed. Add tomatoes (crush by hand or break up in the pot), basil leaves and stems, bay leaf, oregano, and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine.  
4. **Transfer the pot to the oven** (lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape). Bake at **300°F** for **3–4 hours**, stirring every hour and scraping browned bits into the sauce. Reduce by about half.  
5. **Remove bay leaf and basil stems.** Stir in cooked sausage and mushrooms. Adjust seasoning.

#### Make the Ricotta Mix

In a mixing bowl, combine:
- Sheep yogurt  
- Goat cheese  
- 1 cup mozzarella  
- ½ cup Pecorino Romano  
- Eggs  

Mix until well blended.
