Sunday, May 3

Woke up at 6:45am and left the hotel around 7:10am. We caught the tube
to Victoria Station where we caught the 8am train to Gatwick Airport.
Once we got to the airport, we checked our bags in and then ate some
breakfast at McDonalds. We boarded our flight to Dublin just before
10am. We met up with Brendan Tours after getting our bags and were bused
off to the Jury<t_s >Hotel in Dublin. We dropped off our bags, hit the ATM
machine, then took a cab to Kilmainham Goal. We walked around the jail
and even caught Thomas fidgeting with his balls three times on a
security camera. Next, we walked about two miles to the Guinness Hop
Store and museum. Pictures, a short film, and some samples were tasted
before we hailed a cab back to Jury<t_s.> We had just enough time to change
before our three-hour cabaret and Irish dinner. Neil and I had the beef
while James and Thomas had the salmon. The dancing was very good. Around
11:30pm we left for Temple Bar. We walked around for about 20 minutes
before we found a traditional Irish music pub at the Viking museum. We
enjoyed a couple hours listening to the music. I learned a short reel
(jig) from a very nice Irish girl named Maria. I also enjoyed talking to
some guys from Germany. We left the museum around 2am, caught a cab back
to the hotel, and fell asleep by 2:30am. James quote: (to the maid in
the hotel) "Jerky!".
