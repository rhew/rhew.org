Tuesday, May 12

I woke up around 9am and James had already gone to the Embassy. We had
agreed to meet him at Westminster between 9:45 and 10am. Thomas, Neil,
and I met down in the lobby around 9:30, bought some donuts and walked
down to the Abby. It was closed today as well. Apparently, the Queen was
going to be there on Wednesday, so they had to prepare for the ceremony.
We walked around the Abby, and waited for a bus. The traffic was so
backed up that we decided to walk. We stopped at the House Guards to
watch that ceremony on our way to the museum. We stopped in at a pizza
buffet for lunch further along the way. We must have walked 5+ miles
before reaching the British Museum around 1pm. We spent the next two and
a half hours touring the museum. We walked back to the hotel, shopping
at a couple sidewalk stores along the way. Took a shower and James and I
headed off to buy Les Miserables tickets. We got our tickets and then
went down to China Town for dinner. I had the Hot and Sour soup and
chicken fried rice. James had the soup and beef and noodle dish. We made
it to the theatre with one minute to spare. The play was fantastic.
Afterwards, we returned to the hotel. Neil and Thomas were going to bed,
so James and I went back down to the hotel pub by ourselves. One last
beer before we leave Europe. In bed by midnight.
