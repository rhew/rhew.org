Thursday, May 7

Thomas and I woke up too late for breakfast. But with a little luck, we
made it on the bus by 9:30am. Neil limped on after spraining his ankle
during last night's pub crawl. We first stopped by a shopping store
right outside of Killarney for an Irish coffee and some gifts. Next, we
stopped in Waterville near the coast for lunch. I had the chicken
nuggets, Nail ate a ham and cheese, Thomas the fish, and James had the
Fisherman's stew. We made a few more stops for photographs along the way
to Sneem. Back to Killarney for a little shopping and a quick nap
(Thomas and I watched ESPN's baseball game of the week) before our 7
o'clock dinner. We all ate the smoked chicken salad, James had the
pasta, Neil and Thomas had the pork, and I had the spicy beef. We all
had potatoes and tiramisu. Our drink order FINALLY arrived late during
our meal (can you say "No tip"?). After dinner, we went upstairs to
watch "The Simpsons" and "Friends". Around 9:45 we went out to the Danny
Mann pub for great music and beer. We met people from Australia, Canada,
Cary, N.C., and of course, Ireland. Thomas and I went to O'Donahue's for
one last drink before we went to sleep. I just started drinking "lager
and lime", and liked it quite a bit (later to find out it is not
considered a very manly drink).
