Thursday, April 30

We slept very little on the plane and became increasingly tired. We
arrived in England around 7am (Thursday). After a long walk through the
terminals, we found the tube. Neil bought us all daily passes. We rode
the tube for about 45 minutes to Picadilly Circus. The hotel was very
easy to find, I doubted Neil, but he came through with flying colors.
("Dude, that’s not a Dunkin’ Donuts!" - Adam) The room James and I had
contained only one queen-size bed. So he and I watched BBC2 while Neil
got our rooms changed. "Going to the zoo, zoo, zoo…how about you, you,
you.." We moved into our new rooms (two double beds, this time),
unpacked and took a nap from 10am until about 3pm. I walked around
London by myself for about 30 minutes, while James, Neil and Thomas
showered. I met up with James in the hotel lobby a little later and we
walked down to St. James Square, then found Her Majesty’s Theatre. We
met Thomas and Neil back at the hotel and went to eat dinner at
"Football Football". James, Thomas and I ate the fish and chips, while
Neil had the ribs. Back at the hotel, I showered and we all got ready
for the theatre. We saw Phantom of the Opera, then went back to the
hotel to change. We hit a couple pubs around Soho, and then hit Burger
King. Asleep around 12:30am.
