Wednesday, April 29

Neil arrived in Raleigh Tuesday night and spent the night at my house.
We spent much of the evening packing suitcases and doing laundry. Thomas
and his dad picked us up around 8:45am. We picked up James and arrived
at the airport around 9:30am. James had forgotten his camera and
passport, so he took a cab back to his house. While he was gone, Robyn,
his girlfriend, arrived at the airport with his stuff. James’ brother
dropped him back off at the airport. We checked our luggage and passed
through security. My dad surprised us at the airport, by meeting us just
before we left. He was just passing through Raleigh on a trip. When we
arrived in Toronto, we took a taxi to the Sky Dome. We toured the Sky
Dome, then hit McDonald’s for lunch. We walked around downtown for an
hour or so, before stopping at the Eaton Mall. Thomas bought a new
battery for his video camera. We caught a taxi back to the airport and
boarded the plane for London around 6:45pm.
