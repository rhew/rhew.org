Sunday, May 10

Neil and I met James and Thomas in the hotel lobby around 9am. We
checked out of the hotel and caught a cab to the airport. We left Dublin
just before noon. We arrived in Gatwick around 1pm. James had some
trouble getting his passport photos in a photo booth. We took the train
to Victoria Station, then the tube to Green Park, then Picadilly. We
checked back into the Regent Palace around 3pm. We rested until around
7pm or so. We met some girls across the hall from Neil and Thomas named
Becky and Sarah. They were from Leeds and were in London to study
message techniques. They agreed to accompany us to dinner. We hit the
tube around 8pm for Barbican Station. The restaurant was closed, so we
ended up going to another Italian restaurant near the hotel. After
dinner, we went to the hotel pub and drank and talked until 1:45am. We
met someone from Dublin and his wife. We also met some people from
Northern Ireland much later on in the evening. We talked about the Peace
Treaty. Another intense conversation with some more drunk Irishmen. It
seems the Brits look down on the Irish as slow, etc. Kind of like the
way city people talk about country people back in the States.
