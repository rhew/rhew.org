<P><B>2/23/98</B> Phantom tickets have arrived, Neilbo has joined the trip
<P><B>2/7/98</B>  The trip is getting closer, we've bought our tickets and are 
                  starting to lay out some plans.
<P><B>4/21/98</B> We've got a tour through Ireland and about 6 different
                  hotels to stay in (DOH!) The coolest is in Picadilly Circus...
                  Turn on the special light and wait for towels for the only
                  loo on the hall.  Should be interesting.
<P><B>5/14/98</B> After a two week whirl-wind tour of England and Ireland,
		  we're back home in one piece!  My pictures have been dropped
		  off and I should have them back, scanned and posted sometime
		  next week.  For now, I have included some links to some of
		  the places and things we've seen:
<P><B>5/18/98</B> Added an animated gif and still shot of us on the O'Connell 
		  bridge.  Place holders for pictures to be added.
<P><B>6/3/98</B>  Still no pictures.  They're scanned in but I couldn't mail
                  them here.  Please feel free to bug 
                  <A HREF="mailto:mewhitteker@worldnet.att.net">Mark</A>
                  to set up ICQ and SEND ME THOSE PICTURES!
<P><B>1/25/99</B> Adam is releasing the much coveted trip log a day at a time.
                  I'll post them as I get them.
