Thomas woke James and I up at 4am. I think we feel back asleep until
4:30, though. I woke James up and we finished packing our suitcases and
all met up in the hotel lobby. We crammed everything into a cab and
headed for Heathrow. We hit the VAT refund center just before 6am,
checked our bags, then ate breakfast. Neil and I went to Burger King,
James and Thomas ate at the airport restaurant. We took off at 7:45am,
London time.
