Saturday, May 9

I woke up around 8:45am. We all met for breakfast around 9:15. We said
our final goodbyes to our friends on the bus tour and left for the
Shannon Airport at 10:15. The flight was late taking off, finally
getting in the air around 1:15pm. We arrived back in Dublin around 2pm,
gathered our luggage and crammed into a cab. We arrived at the
Burlington Hotel shortly before 3pm. Our reservations were screwed up,
so Neil and I waited in the lobby until 3:30pm before they were finished
preparing our room. We went upstairs, changed clothes and walked to the
National Museum, downtown. There we saw Ireland’s gold, Viking, and
Egyptian exhibits. We then walked all around trying to find somewhere to
eat and settled upon a "Chicago-style" pizza place. The pizza was
terrible, the wing’s were fair at best, and the prices were very high.
After dinner, we hit many pubs throughout Temple Bar: O’Neill’s, The
Auld Dubliner, Quay’s, O’Brien’s to name a few. We also stopped in at
Burger King for a bite to eat around 11pm. More walking around before I
decided to retire to the hotel. After a coke, I was in bed by 1:30am.
Neil and Thomas returned to the hotel shortly after I did, but James
went back to Temple Bar by himself and didn’t get back in until 3am.
Neil quote: "You people give Chicago a bad name."
