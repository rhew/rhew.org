<HR><T><H3> Day 1 </H3>

Wednesday, April 29

<P><P>

Neil arrived in Raleigh Tuesday night and spent the night at my house.
We spent much of the evening packing suitcases and doing laundry. Thomas
and his dad picked us up around 8:45am. We picked up James and arrived
at the airport around 9:30am. James had forgotten his camera and
passport, so he took a cab back to his house. While he was gone, Robyn,
his girlfriend, arrived at the airport with his stuff. James’ brother
dropped him back off at the airport. We checked our luggage and passed
through security. My dad surprised us at the airport, by meeting us just
before we left. He was just passing through Raleigh on a trip. When we
arrived in Toronto, we took a taxi to the Sky Dome. We toured the Sky
Dome, then hit McDonald’s for lunch. We walked around downtown for an
hour or so, before stopping at the Eaton Mall. Thomas bought a new
battery for his video camera. We caught a taxi back to the airport and
boarded the plane for London around 6:45pm.
<HR><T><H3> Day 2 </H3>

Thursday, April 30

<P><P>

We slept very little on the plane and became increasingly tired. We
arrived in England around 7am (Thursday). After a long walk through the
terminals, we found the tube. Neil bought us all daily passes. We rode
the tube for about 45 minutes to Picadilly Circus. The hotel was very
easy to find, I doubted Neil, but he came through with flying colors.
("Dude, that’s not a Dunkin’ Donuts!" - Adam) The room James and I had
contained only one queen-size bed. So he and I watched BBC2 while Neil
got our rooms changed. "Going to the zoo, zoo, zoo…how about you, you,
you.." We moved into our new rooms (two double beds, this time),
unpacked and took a nap from 10am until about 3pm. I walked around
London by myself for about 30 minutes, while James, Neil and Thomas
showered. I met up with James in the hotel lobby a little later and we
walked down to St. James Square, then found Her Majesty’s Theatre. We
met Thomas and Neil back at the hotel and went to eat dinner at
"Football Football". James, Thomas and I ate the fish and chips, while
Neil had the ribs. Back at the hotel, I showered and we all got ready
for the theatre. We saw Phantom of the Opera, then went back to the
hotel to change. We hit a couple pubs around Soho, and then hit Burger
King. Asleep around 12:30am.
<HR><T><H3> Day 3 </H3>

Friday, May 1

<P><P>

Woke up around 9am this morning and bought tickets on the Original
London Sightseeing Tour Bus. We rode the bus from Haymarket to St.
Paul’s on the top of the double decker. It was very cold on the bus and
I managed to switch James’ headphones to German when he wasn’t looking.
We toured the cathedral on our own, but had to leave the crypt in haste
due to a fire. Next, we stopped in to the "Slurping Toad" for an English
lunch. James had a salmon and cream cheese sandwich, Thomas had the
sausage and mash potatoes, and Neil and I had the hamburgers. Neil and I
agreed that the hamburgers were the worst we had ever eaten in our
lives. After lunch, we stopped back in at St. Paul’s Cathedral’s
bookstore, then hopped the bus to the Tower Monument. We climbed the
300+ step monument and took some really neat photographs at the top.
Next we walked across London Bridge and down the street to the London
Dungeon. The tour lasted a little over an hour, listening to stories
about Jack the Ripper among others. Next we walked across the Tower
Bridge to the Tower of London. It was near closing time, so we didn’t
get to go in. We caught a bus back to Haymarket and went back to our
hotel. James and I made travel arrangements for the next day, while Neil
and Thomas went to Tower Records. Shortly afterwards, we caught a city
bus back to the Tower Monument near Fish Street. We stopped in a pub for
a quick pint before meeting up with our walking tour guide, Corrina. We
took the Ghost Walk around the Financial District in light drizzle.
After the tour ended, we had a couple more drinks with our tour guide
and yet another pub. We ate dinner at a very nice Italian restaurant. We
met Anna and Rosella, two of the waitresses and had fun learning some
Italian ("shamo", "stupido", "grazzo", "pazzo"). We left the restaurant
around 11pm and walked back to St. Paul’s Cathedral. ("Excuse me, m’am,
do you speak English?" - Adam) It was very beautiful at night. We caught
a city bus back to Picadilly Circus and after a little BBC, called it a
night.
<HR><T><H3> Day 4 </H3>

Saturday, May 2

<P><P>

James and I woke up around 7:50am and scrambled to get ready by five
after eight. We all quickly walked down Picadilly to catch a Gray Line
Tour Bus to Stonehenge, Salisbury, and Bath. The pickup spot was very
hard to find, so we were late getting to Berkeley Street, and missed the
bus. A kind porter at the Holiday Inn got us a cab to meet up with the
tour. The cabby dropped us off in time to hop on to the tour bus. Our
first stop was Stonehenge. It was very impressive. Our tour guide talked
about how less than fifty years ago, people were chipping off their own
souvenirs. We walked around, took many pictures and ate some donuts
before getting back on the bus, headed towards Salisbury. We toured the
city from the bus, then stopped a block or so from the cathedral. We
spent about 45 minutes or so touring the beautiful church. Our next stop
was Bath. Here we toured the ancient Roman Baths and ate lunch at Burger
King. I watched some rugby in a pub, while Neil, Thomas, and James went
window shopping. The bus picked us up promptly at 4:25pm. We saw some
beautiful countryside on our two-hour ride back to London. We got off
the bus at Hyde Park, stopped by the Hard Rock Café and some sidewalk
shops on our way back to the hotel. We changed clothes at the hotel,
then headed to China Town for some dinner. After dinner, we walked
around the city, people watching. ("I’m all over that old dude" -
James). We tried to get into the Hippodrome, but the doorman said Neil
was underdressed. We hit two more pubs on our way back to the hotel, one
of which had Karioke. We packed our bags and showered at the hotel, then
went to sleep. We were completely exhausted.
<HR><T><H3> Day 5 </H3>

Sunday, May 3

<P><P>

Woke up at 6:45am and left the hotel around 7:10am. We caught the tube
to Victoria Station where we caught the 8am train to Gatwick Airport.
Once we got to the airport, we checked our bags in and then ate some
breakfast at McDonalds. We boarded our flight to Dublin just before
10am. We met up with Brendan Tours after getting our bags and were bused
off to the Jury<t_s >Hotel in Dublin. We dropped off our bags, hit the ATM
machine, then took a cab to Kilmainham Goal. We walked around the jail
and even caught Thomas fidgeting with his balls three times on a
security camera. Next, we walked about two miles to the Guinness Hop
Store and museum. Pictures, a short film, and some samples were tasted
before we hailed a cab back to Jury<t_s.> We had just enough time to change
before our three-hour cabaret and Irish dinner. Neil and I had the beef
while James and Thomas had the salmon. The dancing was very good. Around
11:30pm we left for Temple Bar. We walked around for about 20 minutes
before we found a traditional Irish music pub at the Viking museum. We
enjoyed a couple hours listening to the music. I learned a short reel
(jig) from a very nice Irish girl named Maria. I also enjoyed talking to
some guys from Germany. We left the museum around 2am, caught a cab back
to the hotel, and fell asleep by 2:30am. James quote: (to the maid in
the hotel) "Jerky!".

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 6 </H3>

Monday, May 4

<P><P>

Neil and I ate some breakfast together around 9:10am. Thomas came and
got us in the restaurant so we didn't miss the bus. James ate a small
breakfast by himself and just made the bus as well. We drove around
Dublin during the morning observing the beautiful Georgian-style
doorways and Christ's Church Cathedral from the bus. After a short tour
of St. Patrick's Cathedral, we went to see the Book of Kells at Trinity
College. We watched a bit of cricket on the university lawn as well. We
walked around the city looking for a restaurant before settling on "The
Alamo", fine Mexican cuisine. Neil and I ate nachos, James and Thomas
ate burritos. After lunch, we went to Dublin Castle and took the
35-minute tour. James and Neil were quick to notice the astrological
signs coming out of Apollo's butt on a finely decorated ceiling. We saw
a table which was carved over a seven year span by a prisoner with a
razor blade. A reggae concert was setting up outside. Next, we split up.
James and Thomas went to find out where the Irish Times camera was set
up on O<t_Co>nnell Street, while Neil and I took 40-minutes to find the
National Gallery. Once we found it, we took the express 10-minute
self-guided fly-through. We all met back at the Irish Times around
5:30pm. We bought wrapping paper, masking tape and markers for our next
endeavor. We then hopped into a pub called "The Fleet" to make a sign to
hold up at the O'Connell Street Bridge. We hurried back to the camera to
put the sign together. We spent about 20 minutes holding up our sign
("DIA DIUT") up towards the camera. We got a lot of odd looks from the
crowd as well as a few questions about the Gaelic. Around seven we
returned to "The Fleet" to take the coins off the sign and drink a
couple beers. Thomas quickly engaged in what turned out to be a two-hour
intense conversation with an Irish Nationalist. James, Neil and I drank
with a couple druggies. We left the bar and meandered around until we
found a cab back to Jury's. We ordered pizza at the hotel, played spades
until around 1:20am, showered, and went to bed. Thomas quote: "I'll blow
you if you blow me." We made a special point to remember the cool noises
the cross-walk signals in downtown Dublin made.
<HR><T><H3> Day 7 </H3>

Tuesday, May 5

<P><P>

Neil and I missed breakfast this morning since we thought we were
leaving at 9:30 instead of 9:00. We left Dublin on the bus towards the
Wicklow Mountains. We stopped in Glendalough to walk around an old
cemetery in a light drizzle. James drank a half-pint of Guinness at just
after 10am in the adjoining coffee shop. Later we stopped at Charles
Parnell<t_s >Avondale House for a short tour. Our next stop was at Gorey
for lunch. Thomas ate some lamb, Nail ate a ham and cheese sandwich, I
ate a ham and cheese sandwich and a BLT, and James ate a chicken
baggette with slaw. Thomas bought a watch, then we met Neil up at the
bus. We drove straight on to Waterford where we met up with Mike, our
Irish walking-tour guide in downtown Waterford. The tour was short, but
very interesting. We then went back to Jury<t_s >Waterford to freshen up
before dinner. James and Thomas ate the lamb with mint jelly, while Neil
and I had the salmon. After dinner, we had a drink at the pub then off
to the swimming pool. Before swimming, I shaved off the lower half of my
goatee, opting to go with the Hulk Hogan look. We had to buy swim caps
before they let us in. We swam some laps before attacking the whirlpool.
Thomas, James, and Neil went in the sauna for a bit, while I relaxed. We
went back to our rooms to change, then back to the hotel pub for cards
and beer. Thomas and I won the game around 2am. We all retired to our
rooms shortly thereafter. James quote: "Are ya knockin<t_?">. Neil action:
Noose around neck and TNT detonation motions on the bus in reference to
the awful "Danny Boy" music we endured on ride to Waterford.

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 8 </H3>

Wednesday, May 6

<P><P>

Neil and I got up early (surprise) and ate breakfast, while James and
Thomas got ready. Around this time, James realized that he had lost his
leather jacket (we later realize his passport was in that jacket). We
left promptly at 9:15 for the Waterford plant. We toured the factory,
then left for Cork. We drove through Cork on our way to Cobh (pronounced
"cove"). This town was nestled on an island inside County Cork. We
visited the multi media exhibit at the restored Victorian Railway
Station, recanting the famous "Queenstown Story". This port played an
important role for emigrating Irish to America, as well as being the
last port of calls for the legendary Titanic and Lusitania. James ate a
pita at the giftshop while taking in the history. Next, we hopped back
on the bus and headed to Blarney Castle. We toured the castle
extensively, even exploring caves with Thomas' zippo lighter. Everyone,
of course, kissed the stone. We ate lunch at a small restaurant in town.
Neil and Thomas ate chicken sandwiches, while I had a couple BLT
baggettes. We then went shopping, buying Waterford crystal and some
sweaters before boarding the bus for Killarney. We arrived at the hotel
around 6pm and rested before dinner at 8pm. We all had the potato soup
and lamb chops. After dinner, we walked around downtown, but ended up at
Scruffy's next to the hotel. I retired early back to the room after a
single beer, while James, Neil and Thomas stayed down at the pub until
4am. I got an uncharacteristic 9 hours of sleep that night. Thomas,
James, and Neil spent the evening entertaining a couple of girls from
Chicago, Margie and Megan.

<HR><T><H3> Day 9 </H3>

Thursday, May 7

<P><P>

Thomas and I woke up too late for breakfast. But with a little luck, we
made it on the bus by 9:30am. Neil limped on after spraining his ankle
during last night's pub crawl. We first stopped by a shopping store
right outside of Killarney for an Irish coffee and some gifts. Next, we
stopped in Waterville near the coast for lunch. I had the chicken
nuggets, Nail ate a ham and cheese, Thomas the fish, and James had the
Fisherman's stew. We made a few more stops for photographs along the way
to Sneem. Back to Killarney for a little shopping and a quick nap
(Thomas and I watched ESPN's baseball game of the week) before our 7
o'clock dinner. We all ate the smoked chicken salad, James had the
pasta, Neil and Thomas had the pork, and I had the spicy beef. We all
had potatoes and tiramisu. Our drink order FINALLY arrived late during
our meal (can you say "No tip"?). After dinner, we went upstairs to
watch "The Simpsons" and "Friends". Around 9:45 we went out to the Danny
Mann pub for great music and beer. We met people from Australia, Canada,
Cary, N.C., and of course, Ireland. Thomas and I went to O'Donahue's for
one last drink before we went to sleep. I just started drinking "lager
and lime", and liked it quite a bit (later to find out it is not
considered a very manly drink).

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 10 </H3>

Friday, May 8

<P><P>

James, Neil, and Thomas got up in time for breakfast, while I slept in a
little longer. We got to the bus by 8:45am, and waited for some
stragglers before heading to Tralee. We hit a museum which had a ride
which was really cool. You sat in this moving cart seeing glimpses of
how life was back in this old Irish town. Thomas and I rode with some
lady and her daughter. We got back on the bus and drove to a small and
beautiful town to take pictures on our way towards Limerick. We drove
straight through Limerick to Folk Land and Bunratty Castle. We arrived
at 1:30pm and only had an hour and a half to explore. We ate lunch ate
Mac's. Thomas and I ate BLTt's, James had an open face seafood sandwich
and Neil had a turkey and bacon sandwich. Thomas and I also had some
potato soup, which was fabulous. We walked around the village and
castle, then returned to the bus by 3:08pm. We headed to the Limerick
Inn Hotel where we relaxed before James, Thomas, and I boarded the bus
for our Medieval banquet at Knappogue Castle. We had an awesome time
being called "my lord". We drank mead and quite a bit of red wine. We
ate smoked salmon, potato soup, bread, carrots, green beans, potatoes,
and chicken. The entertainment was wonderful with lots of dancing and
singing. James was "arrested" for breaking rule #3 (intentionally
dropping bread in order to check out women). King MacNamara pardoned
James only after he sung to the masses. James sung "99 bottles of beer
on the wall". When he cleared his throat before starting to sing, all
the ladies laughed. When we arrived back at the hotel, I went to get
Neil and we all spent the rest of the evening drinking in the hotel pub
and talking to Laverne, Shirley and the mother-in-law of the Chicago
Bear's  place kicker, Jeff Jaeger. I was asleep by 12:30, Thomas a little
later.

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 11 </H3>

Saturday, May 9

<P><P>

I woke up around 8:45am. We all met for breakfast around 9:15. We said
our final goodbyes to our friends on the bus tour and left for the
Shannon Airport at 10:15. The flight was late taking off, finally
getting in the air around 1:15pm. We arrived back in Dublin around 2pm,
gathered our luggage and crammed into a cab. We arrived at the
Burlington Hotel shortly before 3pm. Our reservations were screwed up,
so Neil and I waited in the lobby until 3:30pm before they were finished
preparing our room. We went upstairs, changed clothes and walked to the
National Museum, downtown. There we saw Ireland’s gold, Viking, and
Egyptian exhibits. We then walked all around trying to find somewhere to
eat and settled upon a "Chicago-style" pizza place. The pizza was
terrible, the wing’s were fair at best, and the prices were very high.
After dinner, we hit many pubs throughout Temple Bar: O’Neill’s, The
Auld Dubliner, Quay’s, O’Brien’s to name a few. We also stopped in at
Burger King for a bite to eat around 11pm. More walking around before I
decided to retire to the hotel. After a coke, I was in bed by 1:30am.
Neil and Thomas returned to the hotel shortly after I did, but James
went back to Temple Bar by himself and didn’t get back in until 3am.
Neil quote: "You people give Chicago a bad name."

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 12 </H3>

Sunday, May 10

<P><P>

Neil and I met James and Thomas in the hotel lobby around 9am. We
checked out of the hotel and caught a cab to the airport. We left Dublin
just before noon. We arrived in Gatwick around 1pm. James had some
trouble getting his passport photos in a photo booth. We took the train
to Victoria Station, then the tube to Green Park, then Picadilly. We
checked back into the Regent Palace around 3pm. We rested until around
7pm or so. We met some girls across the hall from Neil and Thomas named
Becky and Sarah. They were from Leeds and were in London to study
message techniques. They agreed to accompany us to dinner. We hit the
tube around 8pm for Barbican Station. The restaurant was closed, so we
ended up going to another Italian restaurant near the hotel. After
dinner, we went to the hotel pub and drank and talked until 1:45am. We
met someone from Dublin and his wife. We also met some people from
Northern Ireland much later on in the evening. We talked about the Peace
Treaty. Another intense conversation with some more drunk Irishmen. It
seems the Brits look down on the Irish as slow, etc. Kind of like the
way city people talk about country people back in the States.

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 13 </H3>

Monday, May 11

<P><P>

James got up around 9am and headed to the American Embassy to get a
passport. Neil, Thomas, and I got up a bit later and walked down to
Buckingham Palace. We watched the "Inspection of the Guards" ceremony
before heading towards Trafalgar Square to meet up with James. We passed
Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster, and some royal guards on our way. We
met James at 12 noon at Nelson's statue, then went by McDonald's, then
past 10 Downing Street (where the Prime Minister works) on our way to
the Cabinet War Rooms. Next we went to Westminster Abby, but it was
closed. We went to the National Gallery next back in Trafalgar Square.
There we saw Rembrandt's, Ruben's, van Dyke's, Titian's, Botticelli's,
and some Raphael's. We stayed there until around 3:15 or so. We were
able to see every wing except the Impressionists. We took the 15 bus to
Tower Hill. We got to the Tower of London around 4pm, and toured for an
hour and a half. We saw the crown jewels, and all sorts of other stuff
before heading back to the hotel. By the time we got back it was 6:15pm.
James showered, then he and I went to see Beauty and the Beast. We ate a
hot dog on the way to the play. At the play, James and I had some
popcorn, some cakes, and some Groelsh. After the play, James and I had
some beers at the hotel pub and met Janet and Eva from Hamburg, Germany.
They went to bed, then Becky and Sarah came by for some drinks. Neil and
Thomas, of course, followed some 5-10 minutes behind. Neil took the
video camera upstairs and passed out shortly after. Thomas, James and I
went to Burger King. James sat in the middle of us. Thomas was going on
and on about Sarah and Becky, while James wrote "HELP" in his french
fries. I laughed so hard that I shot Pepsi through my nose. Later, James
wrote "S.O.S." with straw wrappers and his drink lid. In bed by 2am or
so.

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 14 </H3>

Tuesday, May 12

<P><P>

I woke up around 9am and James had already gone to the Embassy. We had
agreed to meet him at Westminster between 9:45 and 10am. Thomas, Neil,
and I met down in the lobby around 9:30, bought some donuts and walked
down to the Abby. It was closed today as well. Apparently, the Queen was
going to be there on Wednesday, so they had to prepare for the ceremony.
We walked around the Abby, and waited for a bus. The traffic was so
backed up that we decided to walk. We stopped at the House Guards to
watch that ceremony on our way to the museum. We stopped in at a pizza
buffet for lunch further along the way. We must have walked 5+ miles
before reaching the British Museum around 1pm. We spent the next two and
a half hours touring the museum. We walked back to the hotel, shopping
at a couple sidewalk stores along the way. Took a shower and James and I
headed off to buy Les Miserables tickets. We got our tickets and then
went down to China Town for dinner. I had the Hot and Sour soup and
chicken fried rice. James had the soup and beef and noodle dish. We made
it to the theatre with one minute to spare. The play was fantastic.
Afterwards, we returned to the hotel. Neil and Thomas were going to bed,
so James and I went back down to the hotel pub by ourselves. One last
beer before we leave Europe. In bed by midnight.

<P><P>

<HR><T><H3> Day 15 </H3>

Wednesday, May 13

<P><P>

Thomas woke James and I up at 4am. I think we feel back asleep until
4:30, though. I woke James up and we finished packing our suitcases and
all met up in the hotel lobby. We crammed everything into a cab and
headed for Heathrow. We hit the VAT refund center just before 6am,
checked our bags, then ate breakfast. Neil and I went to Burger King,
James and Thomas ate at the airport restaurant. We took off at 7:45am,
London time.
